# Love Calculator ❤️

The **Love Calculator** is a fun web app that calculates compatibility between two names. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it generates a playful compatibility score with interactive animations and a responsive design. It’s a light-hearted way to calculate love potential based on names!

## How It Works

1. The user enters two names into the provided input fields.
2. When the "Calculate Love" button is clicked, the app compares the letters of both names.
3. It uses a predefined algorithm to calculate a compatibility percentage, based on how similar the letters and patterns are between the two names.
4. A random factor is also added to keep the results fun and unpredictable.
5. The app displays the result as a percentage, indicating the compatibility between the two names.

The calculation is entirely for fun, providing users with a playful result each time they try different name combinations!
